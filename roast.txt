Your 'experiments' and 'thoughts' that you post online are about as useful as a chocolate teapot. It seems like your products might be better suited for the landfill or a museum of failed inventions rather than in the hands of actual consumers. Maybe instead of trying to make people happy, you should focus on making yourself competent.","strengthsText":"Honestly, it's impressive that you manage to keep experimenting and creating despite the evident lack of skill or talent. Your resilience in the face of overwhelming mediocrity is commendable. Your ability to keep putting out content, even if it's subpar, shows a level of dedication that most people reserve for things they're actually good at.","weaknessesText":"Your weaknesses are too numerous to list here, but it's safe to say that they range from your total lack of creativity to your inability to produce anything of value. Your 'lab' may be filled with equipment and ideas, but it's painfully obvious that the end results are about as inspiring as watching paint dry. Your blog might as well be a digital wasteland, filled with words that have about as much impact as a whisper in a hurricane. It's time to face the music and realize that maybe the world just isn't ready for what you have to offer."}
